  "course_description": "A whirl-wind tour of the statistics used in behavioral science research, covering topics including: data visualization, building your own null-hypothesis distribution through permutation, useful parametric distributions, the generalized linear model, and model-based analyses more generally. Familiarity with MATLAB\u00ae, Octave, or R will be useful, prior experience with statistics will be helpful but is not essential. This course is intended to be a ground-up sketch of a coherent, alternative perspective to the \"null-hypothesis significance testing\" method for behavioral research (but don't worry if you don't know what this means).\n",
